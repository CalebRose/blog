description: What is the Rubicon?
---

Welcome!

You probably have a lot of questions... What is this site? Why is it aesthetically different from my main site? What purpose does the Rubicon serve?

Well, don't fret. This post is here to answer all of your questions

### This is my Personal Blog.

This is where I have decided to place all of my personal thoughts and stories -- everything from projects, my daily life, and tidbits that I find around the internet.

I've previously made efforts to use other sites for this very purpose -- I used Wordpress a couple of years ago for this exact purpose. And while there was some success, I felt like I didn't have full control over my content, the design, and the maintainability of past sites.

I looked at other options -- Squarespace, Google blogs, and found similar results.

So, I withheld my efforts for the time being until I felt comfortable with building the site how I wanted to.

Over the past year and a half, I've been learning how to build and develop websites from scratch. I'm very familiar with web development languages and frameworks such as Javascript, React, and wanted to utilize these skillsets for personal interests.

I had already created a portfolio site; but with the overall design of the portfolio site, I felt as though a blog would be out of place with the scope of that site.

...Which led me to decide to build the Rubicon.

### The Design

I wanted to keep the simplicity of my portfolio site -- a photo backdrop with a few select options. The site is designed to be legible with a dark background and readable through a mobile device.

There's still a bit of work to be done. I want to implement navigation so that users can navigate and find blog posts that they wish to read. Along with that, there are some choices that I'm considering from the Instagram link & the footer. But for now, this is the site's design.

### Why Rubicon?

It's a word I've stuck in my head since university. If you google it, you'll find an idiom about _Crossing the Rubicon_.

In 49 b.c., Julius Caesar moved his army across the Rubicon River towards Rome. The action itself broke imperial law and was considered irrevocable. By crossing the river Caesar's army beyond a point of no return.

The Rubicon represents the idea of crossing over -- to venture into worlds unknown, no turning back or second thoughts. To tell stories to entertain, cherish, and provoke.

Since I was young, I've been building worlds and telling stories. Whether it's sharing with my close family, friends, or to you, I want to write stories that can be told for generations.

### Where to Venture First?

I'm working on a new idea, but my plan is to place all of my previous content here for the time being. At the moment, it's only one story -- but it's one that I'm proud of.

So please, grab yourself a cup of tea and make yourself at home. I'm happy to share my thoughts and ideas with you.
